# SMTP-Verify-Usernames
 script uses the socket module to connect to an SMTP server ( Metasploitable ) specified by the user and verifies the existence of a list of usernames provided in a file. If a username exists on the server, it prints a message indicating that the user is recorded; otherwise, it continues to the next username.
